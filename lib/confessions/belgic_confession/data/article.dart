          "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it. For since the entire manner of service which God requires of us is described in it at great length, no one -- even an apostle or an angel from heaven, as Paul says -- (Gal. 1:8) ought to teach other than what the Holy Scriptures have already taught us.  For since it is forbidden to add to or subtract from the Word of God, (Deut. 12:32; Rev. 22:18-19) this plainly demonstrates that the teaching is perfect and complete in all respects.\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings -- no matter how holy their authors may have been -- equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of time or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else.\n\nFor all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself.\n\nTherefore we reject with all our hearts everything that does not agree with this infallible rule, as we are taught to do by the apostles when they say, \"Test the spirits to see if they are of God,\" (1 John 4:1) and also, \"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house.\" (2 John 10)",

The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible.\n\nThe Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son.\n\nNevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has his own subsistence distinguished by characteristics -- yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God.\n\nIt is evident then that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father, and that likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son.\n\nNevertheless, these persons, thus distinct, are neither divided nor fused or mixed together.\n\nFor the Father did not take on flesh, nor did the Spirit, but only the Son.\n\nThe Father was never without his Son, nor without his Holy Spirit, since all these are equal from eternity, in one and the same essence.\n\nThere is neither a first nor a last, for all three are one in truth and power, in goodness and mercy.",

      content:
          "All these things we know from the testimonies of Holy Scripture as well as from the effects of the persons, especially from those we feel within ourselves.\n\nThe testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, which teach us to believe in this Holy Trinity, are written in many places of the Old Testament, which need not be enumerated but only chosen with discretion.\n\nIn the book of Genesis God says, \”Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.\”  So \”God created man in his own image\” -- indeed, \”male and female he created them.\” (Gen. 1:26-27) \”Behold, man has become like one of us.\” (Gen. 3:22)\n\nIt appears from this that there is a plurality of persons within the Deity, when he says, \”Let us make man in our image\” -- and afterwards he indicates the unity when he says, \”God created.\”\n\nIt is true that he does not say here how many persons there are -- but what is somewhat obscure to us in the Old Testament is very clear in the New.\n\nFor when our Lord was baptized in the Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard saying, \”This is my dear Son\” (Matt. 3:17); the Son was seen in the water; and the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.\n\nSo, in the baptism of all believers this form was prescribed by Christ: \”Baptize all people in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\” (Matt. 28:19)\n\nIn the Gospel according to Luke the angel Gabriel says to Mary, the mother of our Lord: \”The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore that holy one to be born of you shall be called the Son of God.\” (Luke 1:35)\n\nAnd in another place it says: \”The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.\” (2 Cor. 13:14)\n\n\”There are three who bear witness in heaven -- the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit -- and these three are one.\” (1 John 5:7)\n\nIn all these passages we are fully taught that there are three persons in the one and only divine essence.  And although this doctrine surpasses human understanding, we nevertheless believe it now, through the Word, waiting to know and enjoy it fully in heaven.\n\nFurthermore, we must note the particular works and activities of these three persons in relation to us.  The Father is called our Creator, by reason of his power.  The Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by his blood.  The Holy Spirit is our Sanctifier, by his living in our hearts.\n\nThis doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained in the true church, from the time of the apostles until the present, against Jews, Muslims, and certain false Christians and heretics, such as Marcion, Mani, Praxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Arius, and others like them, who were rightly condemned by the holy fathers.\n\nAnd so, in this matter we willingly accept the three ecumenical creeds -- the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian -- as well as what the ancient fathers decided in agreement with them.",

The apostle says that \”God made the world by his Son.\”  (Heb. 1:2) He also says that \”God created all things by Jesus Christ.\” (Col. 1:16)\n\nAnd so it must follow that he who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ already existed when all things were created by him.\n\nTherefore the prophet Micah says that his origin is \”from ancient times, from eternity.\” (Mic. 5:2) And the apostle says that he has \”neither beginning of days nor end of life.\” (Heb. 7:3)\n\nSo then, he is the true eternal God, the Almighty, whom we invoke, worship, and serve.",

They lie in wait for the church and every member of it like thieves, with all their power, to destroy and spoil everything by their deceptions.\n\nSo then, by their own wickedness they are condemned to everlasting damnation, daily awaiting their torments.\n\nFor that reason we detest the error of the Sadducees, who deny that there are spirits and angels, and also the error of the Manicheans, who say that the devils originated by themselves, being evil by nature, without having been corrupted.",

For his power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible that he arranges and does his work very well and justly even when the devils and wicked men act unjustly.\n\nWe do not wish to inquire with undue curiosity into what he does that surpasses human understanding and is beyond our ability to comprehend. But in all humility and reverence we adore the just judgments of God, which are hidden from us, being content to be Christ's disciples, so as to learn only what he shows us in his Word, without going beyond those limits.\n\nThis doctrine gives us unspeakable comfort since it teaches us that nothing can happen to us by chance but only by the arrangement of our gracious heavenly Father.  He watches over us with fatherly care, keeping all creatures under his control, so that not one of the hairs on our heads (for they are all numbered) nor even a little bird can fall to the ground (Matt. 10:29-30) without the will of our Father.\n\nIn this thought we rest, knowing that he holds in check the devils and all our enemies, who cannot hurt us without his permission and will.\n\nFor that reason we reject the damnable error of the Epicureans, who say that God involves himself in nothing and leaves everything to chance.",

          "We believe that God created man from the dust of the earth and made and formed him in his image and likeness -- good, just, and holy; able by his own will to conform in all things to the will of God.\n\nBut when he was in honor he did not understand it (Ps. 49:20) and did not recognize his excellence.  But he subjected himself willingly to sin and consequently to death and the curse, lending his ear to the word of the devil.\n\nFor he transgressed the commandment of life, which he had received, and by his sin he separated himself from God, who was his true life, having corrupted his entire nature.\n\nSo he made himself guilty and subject to physical and spiritual death, having become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways.  He lost all his excellent gifts which he had received from God, and he retained none of them except for small traces which are enough to make him inexcusable.\n\nMoreover, all the light in us is turned to darkness, as the Scripture teaches us: \”The light shone in the darkness, and the darkness did not receive it.\” (John 1:5) Here John calls men \”darkness.\”\n\nTherefore we reject everything taught to the contrary concerning man's free will, since man is nothing but the slave of sin and cannot do a thing unless it is \”given him from heaven.\” (John 3:27)\n\nFor who can boast of being able to do anything good by himself, since Christ says, \”No one can come to me unless my Father who sent me draws him\”? (John 6:44)\n\nWho can glory in his own will when he understands that \”the mind of the flesh is enmity against God\”? (Rom. 8:7) Who can speak of his own knowledge in view of the fact that \”the natural man does not understand the things of the Spirit of God\”? (1 Cor. 2:14)\n\nIn short, who can produce a single thought, since he knows that we are \”not able to think a thing\” about ourselves, by ourselves, but that \”our ability is from God\”? (2 Cor. 3:5)\n\nAnd therefore, what the apostle says ought rightly to stand fixed and firm: \”God works within us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure.\” (Phil. 2:13)\n\nFor there is no understanding nor will conforming to God's understanding and will apart from Christ's involvement, as he teaches us when he says, \”Without me you can do nothing.\” (John 15:5)",

          "We believe that this true faith, produced in man by the hearing of God's Word and by the work of the Holy Spirit, regenerates him and makes him a \”new man,\” (2 Cor. 5:17) causing him to live the \”new life\” (Rom. 6:4) and freeing him from the slavery of sin.\n\nTherefore, far from making people cold toward living in a pious and holy way, this justifying faith, quite to the contrary, so works within them that apart from it they will never do a thing out of love for God but only out of love for themselves and fear of being condemned.\n\nSo then, it is impossible for this holy faith to be unfruitful in a human being, seeing that we do not speak of an empty faith but of what Scripture calls \”faith working through love,\” (Gal. 5:6) which leads a man to do by himself the works that God has commanded in his Word.\n\nThese works, proceeding from the good root of faith, are good and acceptable to God, since they are all sanctified by his grace.  Yet they do not count toward our justification -- for by faith in Christ we are justified, even before we do good works.  Otherwise they could not be good, any more than the fruit of a tree could be good if the tree is not good in the first place.\n\nSo then, we do good works, but nor for merit -- for what would we merit?   Rather, we are indebted to God for the good works we do, and not he to us, since it is he who \”works in us both to will and do according to his good pleasure\” (Phil. 2:13) -- thus keeping in mind what is written: \”When you have done all that is commanded you, then you shall say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have done what it was our duty to do.' \”(Luke 17:10)\n\nYet we do not wish to deny that God rewards good works -- but it is by his grace that he crowns his gifts.\n\nMoreover, although we do good works we do not base our salvation on them; for we cannot do any work that is not defiled by our flesh and also worthy of punishment.  And even if we could point to one, memory of a single sin is enough for God to reject that work.\n\nSo we would always be in doubt, tossed back and forth without any certainty, and our poor consciences would be tormented constantly if they did not rest on the merit of the suffering and death of our Savior.",

      content:
          "We believe that we have no access to God except through the one and only Mediator and Intercessor: Jesus Christ the Righteous. (1 John 2:1)\n\nHe therefore was made man, uniting together the divine and human natures, so that we human beings might have access to the divine Majesty. Otherwise we would have no access.\n\nBut this Mediator, whom the Father has appointed between himself and us, ought not terrify us by his greatness, so that we have to look for another one, according to our fancy.  For neither in heaven nor among the creatures on earth is there anyone who loves us more than Jesus Christ does.  Although he was \”in the form of God,\” he nevertheless \”emptied himself,\” taking the form of \”a man\” and \”a servant\” for us; (Phil. 2:6-8) and he made himself \”completely like his brothers.\” (Heb. 2:17)\n\nSuppose we had to find another intercessor.  Who would love us more than he who gave his life for us, even though \”we were his enemies\”?  (Rom. 5:10) And suppose we had to find one who has prestige and power.  Who has as much of these as he who is seated \”at the right hand of the Father,\” (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 1:3) and who has all power \”in heaven and on earth\”? (Matt. 28:18) And who will be heard more readily than God's own dearly beloved Son?\n\nSo then, sheer unbelief has led to the practice of dishonoring the saints, instead of honoring them.  That was something the saints never did nor asked for, but which in keeping with their duty, as appears from their writings, they consistently refused.\n\nWe should not plead here that we are unworthy -- for it is not a question of offering our prayers on the basis of our own dignity but only on the basis of the excellence and dignity of Jesus Christ, whose righteousness is ours by faith.\n\nSince the apostle for good reason wants us to get rid of this foolish fear -- or rather, this unbelief -- he says to us that Jesus Christ was \”made like his brothers in all things,\” that he might be a high priest who is merciful and faithful to purify the sins of the people. (Heb. 2:17) For since he suffered, being tempted, he is also able to help those who are tempted. (Heb. 2:18)\n\nAnd further, to encourage us more to approach him he says, \”Since we have a high priest, Jesus the Son of God, who has entered into heaven, we maintain our confession.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to have compassion for our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all things, just as we are, except for sin. Let us go then with confidence to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace, in order to be helped.\” (Heb. 4:14-16)\n\nThe same apostle says that we \”have liberty to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus.  Let us go, then, in the assurance of faith....\” (Heb. 10:19)\n\nLikewise, \”Christ's priesthood is forever.  By this he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him who always lives to intercede for them.\” (Heb. 7:24-25)\n\nWhat more do we need?  For Christ himself declares: \”I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to my Father but by me.\” (John 14:6) Why should we seek another intercessor?\n\nSince it has pleased God to give us his Son as our Intercessor, let us not leave him for another -- or rather seek, without ever finding.  For when God gave him to us he knew well that we were sinners.\n\nTherefore, in following the command of Christ we call on the heavenly Father through Christ, our only Mediator, as we are taught by the Lord's Prayer, being assured that we shall obtain all we ask of the Father in his name.\n\n",

But we are speaking of distinguishing the body and fellowship of the true church from all sects that call themselves \"the church.\"\n\nThe true church can be recognized if it has the following marks: The church engages in the pure preaching of the gospel; it makes use of the pure administration of the sacraments as Christ instituted them; it practices church discipline for correcting faults.  In short, it governs itself according to the pure Word of God, rejecting all things contrary to it and holding Jesus Christ as the only Head.  By these marks one can be assured of recognizing the true church -- and no one ought to be separated from it.\n\nAs for those who can belong to the church, we can recognize them by the distinguishing marks of Christians: namely by faith, and by their fleeing from sin and pursuing righteousness, once they have received the one and only Savior, Jesus Christ.  They love the true God and their neighbors, without turning to the right or left, and they crucify the flesh and its works.\n\nThough great weakness remains in them, they fight against it by the Spirit all the days of their lives, appealing constantly to the blood, suffering, death, and obedience of the Lord Jesus, in whom they have forgiveness of their sins, through faith in him.\n\nAs for the false church, it assigns more authority to itself and its ordinances than to the Word of God; it does not want to subject itself to the yoke of Christ; it does not administer the sacraments as Christ commanded in his Word; it rather adds to them or subtracts from them as it pleases; it bases itself on men, more than on Jesus Christ; it persecutes those who live holy lives according to the Word of God and who rebuke it for its faults, greed, and idolatry.\n\nThese two churches are easy to recognize and thus to distinguish from each other.",

          "We believe and confess that Jesus Christ, in whom the law is fulfilled, has by his shed blood put an end to every other shedding of blood, which anyone might do or wish to do in order to atone or satisfy for sins.\n\nHaving abolished circumcision, which was done with blood, he established in its place the sacrament of baptism.  By it we are received into God's church and set apart from all other people and alien religions, that we may be dedicated entirely to him, bearing his mark and sign.  It also witnesses to us that he will be our God forever, since he is our gracious Father.\n\nTherefore he has commanded that all those who belong to him be baptized with pure water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (Matt. 28:19)\n\nIn this way he signifies to us that just as water washes away the dirt of the body when it is poured on us and also is seen on the body of the baptized when it is sprinkled on him, so too the blood of Christ does the same thing internally, in the soul, by the Holy Spirit.  It washes and cleanses it from its sins and transforms us from being the children of wrath into the children of God.\n\nThis does not happen by the physical water but by the sprinkling of the precious blood of the Son of God, who is our Red Sea, through which we must pass to escape the tyranny of Pharoah, who is the devil, and to enter the spiritual land of Canaan.\n\nSo ministers, as far as their work is concerned, give us the sacrament and what is visible, but our Lord gives what the sacrament signifies -- namely the invisible gifts and graces; washing, purifying, and cleansing our souls of all filth and unrighteousness; renewing our hearts and filling them with all comfort; giving us true assurance of his fatherly goodness; clothing us with the \”new man\” and stripping off the \”old,\” with all its works.\n\nFor this reason we believe that anyone who aspires to reach eternal life ought to be baptized only once without ever repeating it -- for we cannot be born twice.  Yet this baptism is profitable not only when the water is on us and when we receive it but throughout our entire lives.\n\nFor that reason we detest the error of the Anabaptists who are not content with a single baptism once received and also condemn the baptism of the children of believers.  We believe our children ought to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as little children were circumcised in Israel on the basis of the same promises made to our children.\n\nAnd truly, Christ has shed his blood no less for washing the little children of believers than he did for adults.\n\nTherefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament of what Christ has done for them, just as the Lord commanded in the law that by offering a lamb for them the sacrament of the suffering and death of Christ would be granted them shortly after their birth.  This was the sacrament of Jesus Christ.\n\nFurthermore, baptism does for our children what circumcision did for the Jewish people.  That is why Paul calls baptism the \”circumcision of Christ.\” (Col. 2:11)",

The one is physical and temporal -- they have it from the moment of their first birth, and it is common to all.  The other is spiritual and heavenly, and is given them in their second birth; it comes through the Word of the gospel in the communion of the body of Christ; and this life is common to God's elect only.\n\nThus, to support the physical and earthly life God has prescribed for us an appropriate earthly and material bread, which is as common to all as life itself also is.  But to maintain the spiritual and heavenly life that belongs to believers he has sent a living bread that came down from heaven: namely Jesus Christ, who nourishes and maintains the spiritual life of believers when eaten -- that is, when appropriated and received spiritually by faith.\n\nTo represent to us this spiritual and heavenly bread Christ has instituted an earthly and visible bread as the sacrament of his body and wine as the sacrament of his blood.  He did this to testify to us that just as truly as we take and hold the sacraments in our hands and eat and drink it in our mouths, by which our life is then sustained, so truly we receive into our souls, for our spiritual life, the true body and true blood of Christ, our only Savior.  We receive these by faith, which is the hand and mouth of our souls.\n\nNow it is certain that Jesus Christ did not prescribe his sacraments for us in vain, since he works in us all he represents by these holy signs, although the manner in which he does it goes beyond our understanding and is uncomprehensible to us, just as the operation of God's Spirit is hidden and incomprehensible.\n\nYet we do not go wrong when we say that what is eaten is Christ's own natural body and what is drunk is his own blood -- but the manner in which we eat it is not by the mouth but by the Spirit, through faith.\n\nIn that way Jesus Christ remains always seated at the right hand of God the Father in heaven -- but he never refrains on that account to communicate himself to us through faith.\n\nThis banquet is a spiritual table at which Christ communicates himself to us with all his benefits.  At that table he makes us enjoy himself as much as the merits of his suffering and death, as he nourishes, strengthens, and comforts our poor, desolate souls by the eating of his flesh, and relieves and renews them by the drinking of his blood.\n\nMoreover, though the sacraments and thing signified are joined together, not all receive both of them.  The wicked person certainly takes the sacrament, to his condemnation, but does not receive the truth of the sacrament, just as Judas and Simon the Sorcerer both indeed received the sacrament, but not Christ, who was signified by it.  He is communicated only to believers.\n\nFinally, with humility and reverence we receive the holy sacrament in the gathering of God's people, as we engage together, with thanksgiving, in a holy remembrance of the death of Christ our Savior, and as we thus confess our faith and Christian religion.  Therefore no one should come to this table without examining himself carefully, lest \”by eating this bread and drinking this cup he eat and drink to his own judgment.\” (1 Cor. 11:27)\n\nIn short, by the use of this holy sacrament we are moved to a fervent love of God and our neighbors.\n\nTherefore we reject as desecrations of the sacraments all the muddled ideas and damnable inventions that men have added and mixed in with them.  And we say that we should be content with the procedure that Christ and the apostles have taught us and speak of these things as they have spoken of them.",

And as for those who are still alive, they will not die like the others but will be changed \”in the twinkling of an eye\” from \”corruptible to incorruptible.\” (1 Cor. 15:51-53)\n\nThen \”the books\” (that is, the consciences) will be opened, and the dead will be judged according to the things they did in the world, (Rev. 20:12) whether good or evil.   Indeed, all people will give account of all the idle words they have spoken, (Matt. 12:36) which the world regards as only playing games.  And then the secrets and hypocrisies of men will be publicly uncovered in the sight of all.\n\nTherefore, with good reason the thought of this judgment is horrible and dreadful to wicked and evil people.  But it is very pleasant and a great comfort to the righteous and elect, since their total redemption will then be accomplished.  They will then receive the fruits of their labor and of the trouble they have suffered; their innocence will be openly recognized by all; and they will see the terrible vengeance that God will bring on the evil ones who tyrannized, oppressed, and tormented them in this world.\n\nThe evil ones will be convicted by the witness of their own consciences, and shall be made immortal -- but only to be tormented in the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
